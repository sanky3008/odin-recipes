        furthermore, some more additional tips, suggestions and variants to the popular desi masala pasta recipe. 
        firstly, the use of juicy and ripe tomatoes are very critical for this recipe. i have used ripe roma tomatoes for this recipe and it helps to give you the sweet and sour taste of the final end product. 
        secondly, i have added spices like garam masala, coriander powder, cumin with pepper for the perfect desi taste. but if you feel that it is too much of spices, you skip all and use just garam masala spice mix. 
        lastly, the use of vegetables is open-ended and you can use them as per your choice and preference. yet avoid using vegetables like potatoes, beetroot, cauliflower or even leafy vegetables like spinach, pudina or mint leaves.
